<!--                        Fernando Diaz Avila's Assignment
    Planning:
        I can refrence all my previous codes and work my way top down for each file (HTML, JS, & CSS). For the half
        way warning I can use the If/else function either inside the loop at the start to check when the countdown 
        is <= 5 to display the message. Or after the program has display the current time, But before adding that finction
        I will manipulate the string to be outputted onto the webpage rather than the console log. From there after all
        my code runs smoothly I will decorate the Launch button, and website.

    What do I need to have?;
        Im required to add an If/else stament for the half way warning,and create a great user experience.
    What can I do to improve for next time?
        I will like to try finding the font that the alarm clocks have to be only for the time and attempt to add sound 
        for the countdown and warnings.
